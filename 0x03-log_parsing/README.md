# Log Parsing
This project contains interview coding challenges.

### Concepts Needed:
- File I/O in Python:

- Understand how to read from sys.stdin line by line.
Python Input and Output
Signal Handling in Python:

- Handling keyboard interruption (CTRL + C) using signal handling in Python.
Python Signal Handling
Data Processing:

- Parsing strings to extract specific data points.
Aggregating data to compute summaries.
Regular Expressions:

- Using regular expressions to validate the format of each line.
Python Regular Expressions
Dictionaries in Python:

- Using dictionaries to count occurrences of status codes and accumulate file sizes.
Python Dictionaries
Exception Handling:

- Handling possible exceptions that may arise during file reading and data processing.
